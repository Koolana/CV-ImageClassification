# CV-ImageClassification

## Code requirements
numpy: pip3 install numpy

opencv: pip3 install opencv-python

torch: pip3 install torch

glob: pip3 install glob

## File "main.py"
Creating a custom dataset and data loader in Pytorch is described in detail in [the documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/data_tutorial.html)

We define the init function to initialize our variables. The variable self.imgs_path contains the base path to our "dataset" folder

## Dataset
The folder structure is as follows. We have the Project folder that contains the code main.py and code model.py, and a folder called "dataset". This folder called "dataset" is the dataset folder that contains 4 subfolders inside it called Soup, Dessert, Meat and Bread.
